Async TCP Library for ESP8266 and ESP32/31B Arduino

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer](https://badges.gitter.im/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer.svg)](https://gitter.im/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a fully asynchronous TCP library, aimed at enabling trouble-free, multi-connection network environment for Espressif's ESP8266 and ESP32 MCUs.

This library is the base for [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

## AsyncClient and AsyncServer
The base classes on which everything else is built. They expose all possible scenarios, but are really raw and require more skills to use.

## AsyncPrinter
This class can be used to wrap around ```AsyncClient``` (let's say onConnect). From then on, sending data is like any other ```Print``` interface.
The object then can be used outside of the Async callbacks (the loop) and receive asynchronously data using ```onData```. The object can be checked if the underlying ```AsyncClient```is connected, or hook to the ```onDisconnect``` callback.

## AsyncTCPbuffer
This class is really similar to the ```AsyncPrinter```, but it differs in the fact that it can buffer some of the incoming data.

## SyncClient
It is exactly what it sounds like. This is a standard, blocking TCP Client, similar to the one included in ```ESP8266WiFi```
